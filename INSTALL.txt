The Zephyr game engine requires four major dependencies to work properly.
It needs:
 - openGL
 - SDL2
 - OcamlSDL2
 - OcamlSdlImage.

Before proceeding with the installation of those libraries, use the command 
 $ sudo apt-get update
Usually, this solves some issues that arise when trying to install the libraries.

To install openGL, use the command
 $ apt install mesa-utils libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev
To test that this works properly, run the command
 $ glxgears
If the installation was successful, some spinning gears should display on screen.

We assume that the user is using some sort of Debian, Ubuntu, 
or any derivative Linux distributions (so this guide also works 
for wsl2, assuming such a distro is used.) In addition, if you 
are using Windows 10, please see the guide at 
https://gist.github.com/Mluckydwyer/8df7782b1a6a040e5d01305222149f3c#2-window-server 
to install a window server. This should not be necessary if you are using Windows 11.

To install SDL2, run the command
 $ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0-0

Finally, Zephyr is known to work with version 5.0.0 of the Ocaml compiler,
(i.e. the one currently used in CS3110), so please make sure this is the version
you are using.

To install SDL2 and the SDL2 image bindings, use the following commands
 $ opam install ocamlsdl2
 $ opam install ocamlsdl2-image

Finally, to build the game and play it use the commands
 $ make build
 $ make run
