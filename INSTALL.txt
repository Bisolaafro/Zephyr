INSTALLATION

The Zephyr game engine requires several dependencies to run. Some of them 
are specific to OCaml, while the others are required for SDL.
The OCaml dependencies and their versions are the following: 
 - ocamlsdl2            0.04
 - ocamlsdl2-image      0.01
 - ocamlsdl2-ttf        0.02
 - tsdl                 1.0.0
 - tsdl-mixer           0.6
 - yojson               2.1.0

In addition, we are using compiler version 5.0.0 in our project, which is the
one currently used in class. Further, as of 12/0/23, opam will install the above
packages with the right version, so using the following commands should suffice:
 $ opam install ocamlsdl2
 $ opam install ocamlsdl2-image
 $ opam install ocamlsdl2-ttf
 $ opam install tsdl
 $ opam install tsdl-mixer
 $ opam install yojson
(the last one, yojson, may or may not be already installed on your system)

However, if the right version of OCamlSDL2 is not installed, you can try using,
for example:
 $ opam install "ocamlsdl2=0.04"
This tells opam to install the version number after the equal sign. 

Finally, our project depends almost entirely on SDL2, so you will need to
install it. Two of the team members are running WSL2 and Ubuntu 22.04.3 and one
is running MacOS. If you have never installed SDL2, running the command:
 $ opam install ocamlsdl2
should have prompted you to also install SDL2. If this was not the case, the
command that the Ubuntu users used to install it was:
 $ apt-get install libsdl2-dev
In addition to installing SDL, the project requires sdl_mixer, sdl_ttf, and
sdl_image.  Using the above command should also install these packages.
On a technical note, the above command installs the following version of SDL2
and extra packages (such as sdl_mixer):
 libsdl2-2.0-0:amd64               2.0.20+dfsg-2ubuntu1.22.04.1
 libsdl2-dev:amd64                 2.0.20+dfsg-2ubuntu1.22.04.1
 libsdl2-image-dev:amd64           2.0.5+dfsg1-3build1
 libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0:amd64         2.0.4+dfsg1-4build1
 libsdl2-mixer-dev:amd64           2.0.4+dfsg1-4build1
 libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0:amd64           2.0.18+dfsg-2
 libsdl2-ttf-dev:amd64             2.0.18+dfsg-2  

Crucially, note that the SDL2 version shown above is 2.0.20, which is the
version our project is known to work with. 

As a side note, for most of the duration of the project, all team members used
Windows machines with WSL2. However, a team member's computer broke and they
started using a Mac. When running the installation command for ocamlsdl2, SDL2
version 2.28.5 was installed, on which the project has also proven to work.
However, we have not tested whether our project works with any other versions of
SDL2. 

After everything is installed, you can build the project with:
 $ make build
Or run it with:
 $ make run


MISCELLANEOUS

To run the testing script, you can use the command:
 $ make test
Note that we used the OUnit2 package for this, but this is standard in the class 
so we didn't show how to install it. 

To generate the documentation using odoc, use the command:
 $ make doc
Which you can open with:
 $ make opendoc
