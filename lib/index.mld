{0 Zephyr Game Engine}

This package contains the Zephyr 2D game engine and a small game that was 
made using it. The development of this engine was made possible thanks
to the [OcamlSDL2] and accompanying libraries.

Zephyr contains several modules and tools that should allow for streamlined
game development. The modules can be found in the {!module: final} 
package documentation.
